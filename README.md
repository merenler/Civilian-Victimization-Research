A SOCIAL CONTROL THEORY: BRIDGING THE INFORMATION-VIOLENCE GAP: HOW CAN INFORMATION PROVISION AFFECT STATES’ TENDENCY TOWARD
VIOLENCE AGAINST CIVILIANS?
In this research, I argue that “social control” over
the population offers the potential to dramatically change the environment in which all of the actors
(the government, rebel groups, and civilians) live, facilitating an end to the civil war, or at least
alleviating some of its negative consequences. Ever-growing surveillance and dataveillance
practices make this social control possible. When civilians believe that they are being closely
watched by their government (and might be punished for real or perceived disobedience), they
instinctively refrain from behaviors they believe might incite the government to use violence, which
in turn leads states to perpetrate less violence against civilians. For the state, this environment of
constant surveillance and the information it yields substantially affect the level of virtual control
that can be exerted, thereby reducing the amount of violence the state needs to initiate.
